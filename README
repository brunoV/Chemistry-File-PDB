Chemistry/File/PDB version 0.15
===============================

This module reads PDB files. The PDB file format is commonly used to describe
proteins, particularly those stored in the Protein Data Bank
(L<http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/>). The current version of this module only reads
the ATOM and HETATM records, ignoring everything else.

This module automatically registers the 'pdb' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that PDB files may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol->read().

The PDB reader returns a Chemistry::MacroMol object, by default, but the user
is free to give any object to the read method, as long as it implements the
same interface as Chemistry::Mol.
