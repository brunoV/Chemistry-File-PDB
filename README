Chemistry/File/PDB version 0.10
===============================

This module reads PDB files. The PDB file format is commonly used to describe
proteins, particularly those stored in the Protein Data Bank
(L<http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/>). The current version of this module only reads
the ATOM records, ignoring everything else.

This module automatically registers the 'pdb' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that PDB files may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol::read_mol().

The PDB reader returns a Chemistry::MacroMol object, by default, but the
user is free to give any object to the pdb_read subroutine, as long as it
implements the same interface as Chemistry::Mol.
