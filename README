Chemistry/File/PDB version 0.21
===============================

This module reads and writes PDB files. The PDB file format is commonly used to
describe proteins, particularly those stored in the Protein Data Bank
(L<http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/>). The current version of this module only uses the
ATOM and HETATM records, ignoring everything else.

This module automatically registers the 'pdb' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that PDB files may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol->read(). For 
autodetection purpuses, it assumes that files ending in .pdb or having 
a line matching /^(ATOM  |HETATM)/ are PDB files.

The PDB reader and writer is designed for dealing with Chemistry::MacroMol
objects, but it can also create and use Chemistry::Mol objects by throwing some
information away.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.20
        - Changed parse_file to read_mol
        - Read multi-model files (each model read as one molecule)
        - Read chain id and insertion code
