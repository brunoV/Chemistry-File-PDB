Chemistry/File/PDB version 0.23
===============================

This module reads and writes PDB files. The PDB file format is commonly used to
describe proteins, particularly those stored in the Protein Data Bank
(L<http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/>). The current version of this module only uses the
ATOM and HETATM records, ignoring everything else.

This module automatically registers the 'pdb' format with Chemistry::Mol,
so that PDB files may be identified and read by Chemistry::Mol->read(). For 
autodetection purpuses, it assumes that files ending in .pdb or having 
a line matching /^(ATOM  |HETATM)/ are PDB files.

The PDB reader and writer is designed for dealing with Chemistry::MacroMol
objects, but it can also create and use Chemistry::Mol objects by throwing some
information away.

CHANGES SINCE VERSION 0.21
        - Add unique ID to atom names when generating from a $mol object.
        - Also treat END as a molecule separator in multi-molecule files.
        - Fixed insertion code bug (thanks to kparkes).
        - Fixed memory leak.
        - Fixed a couple of atom symbol bugs.
        - Add a title on output.
